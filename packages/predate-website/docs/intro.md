# Introduction

`predate` was inspired by [`date-fns`](https://date-fns.org/) but it's from the ground up considered to be used with [`TypeScript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
One of the key difference is that `predate` uses three different main types ([`PreDate`](/docs/api/types/PreDate), [`PreTime`](/docs/api/types/PreTime) and [`PreDateTime`](/docs/api/types/PreDateTime)) to represent your data.
